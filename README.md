# COMP 304 - Mobile Application Development Fall2018
## Lab Assignment #5
The purpose of this lab assignment is to:
- Develop Android applications with Location-Based Services (LBS) capabilities

## Exercise 1
Write an Android app that allows users to locate various restaurants in the city of Toronto. Your
interface should display a list of available restaurants and their address. The application should
display the **map and satellite map** of the restaurant whenever user selects the name in the list.

Make sure to classify restaurants according to their **cuisine**. For example: italian, greek, chinese,
indian, etc. The first activity shows a list of different cuisines. Other activities show the **list** of
restaurants belonging to the selected cuisine. When user selects a restaurant, another activity
shows the map with a **marker** pointing to the selected restaurant.

Provide a friendly and nice UI. Use ListView controls for displaying the list of cuisines and
restaurants. Use styles to create nice displays of lists.
